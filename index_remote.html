        <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Mukonda and I am from Johannesburg South Africa I enjoy working with and empowering
            underserved
            communities through access to quality education and mentorship. I grew up in a poor community and had to
            learn
            skills and
            trade in the most difficult circumstances have led me to have this vision of helping young people.
            I use my skills to train, coach, and inspire young people — especially those lacking father figures —
            to build strong values, grow with purpose, and lead meaningful lives. By helping them become leaders in
            their own
            communities,
            I aim to spark a cycle of positive change that empowers others in turn.</p>
